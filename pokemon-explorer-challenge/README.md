# Pokémon Explorer Challenge

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Pokémon Explorer challenge! In this exercise, you'll build a minimal full-stack application that allows users to search for Pokémon by name and display their basic information.

**Why this challenge?** This exercise evaluates your skills in:

- API routing and data transformation
- React state management and hooks
- Error handling
- Communication of technical decisions

## Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 14
- Internet access (to fetch from PokeAPI)

## Repository Layout

```

## Getting Started

Clone and install dependencies
git clone git@github.com:your-org/pokemon-explorer-challenge.git
cd pokemon-explorer-challenge
In one terminal: launch backend
cd backend && npm install && npm start
In another terminal: launch frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev

The backend will run on http://localhost:3001
The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000

## Your Tasks

### Backend Task

Implement the GET `/api/pokemon/:name` endpoint in `backend/routes/pokemon.js`:

1. Fetch Pokémon data from the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{name})
2. Transform the response to include only:
   - name
   - sprite (front_default image URL)
   - types (array of type names)
3. Handle errors appropriately (404 for Pokémon not found, 500 for server errors)

### Frontend Task

Implement the `fetchPokemon()` function in `frontend/pages/index.js`:

1. Call your backend API with the user's input
2. Manage loading, success, and error states
3. Display the Pokémon information in a user-friendly way

## Timebox & Workflow

You will be presenting your solution on Monday 30th of June, AM and your time will be sent to you in due course.
Make small, descriptive commits as you go (e.g., "feat: stubbed pokemon route", "fix: add loading state").

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion               | What to Show                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spec Understanding      | Asks about input validation, 404 vs. network errors              |
| Code Organization       | Clear separation of route logic vs. helpers; component structure |
| Error Handling          | Handles non-200 responses, invalid input gracefully              |
| React Patterns          | Correct use of hooks; avoids unnecessary re-renders              |
| UX States               | Loading spinner/text; disabled button; clear error messaging     |
| Communication & Process | Verbalizes trade-offs; sketches data flow                        |
| (Bonus) Testing         | One small unit test for backend or frontend                      |

## Tips & Hints

- **Stub First**: Return hard-coded JSON so you can wire UI to API quickly.
- **Incremental**: Swap in real fetch logic only after stub is working.
- **Ask Questions**: Clarify edge cases—capitalization, timeouts, caching.

## Submission

When time is up, push your solution to a feature branch and share the link. Be prepared to walk through your solution and discuss your approach.

Good luck!
